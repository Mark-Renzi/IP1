Ninja-Se Software Engineering Project 1

TO GRADERS: I took WebWare last term and built this using Node.js so this is ready to deploy to the internet because I'm much more familiar with that as a starting point. To view it live go to my page: [Hosted on Glitch](https://ninjase.glitch.me/). If you want to run it locally, run 'npm install' in the containing folder, then 'npm run build', and then 'npm start'.  Then navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
